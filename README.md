// used proxy in package.json for testing
proxy: To fix CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which is like a virtual security fence that stops your website from getting data from that server.

Imagine you're building a website using React, and your website needs to get information from a server running at http://localhost:5000 (a local server on your computer). However, there's a little catch. Sometimes, when your website tries to get this information, it might run into a problem called "CORS" â€“ which is like a virtual security fence that stops your website from getting data from that server.

To solve this problem, you can use a "proxy." Think of the proxy like a friendly helper. Your website can talk to this helper (the proxy), and the helper will then go and talk to the server for you. Since the helper is on the same "team" as your website, it doesn't have to worry about the CORS security fence. It can easily fetch the data from the server and give it back to your website.

So, by setting "proxy": "http://localhost:5000" in your project's configuration, you're basically telling your website to use this helpful proxy whenever it needs data from http://localhost:5000. The proxy acts as a bridge, making sure your website gets the information it needs without running into CORS issues.

This way, your website and the server can work together smoothly, like a great team, with the proxy handling any security obstacles that might get in the way.
